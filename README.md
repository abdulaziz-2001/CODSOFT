CODSOFT Machine Learning Internship

Task 1: Movie Genre Classification
The Project was on Movie Genre Classification.
The Data was quite imbalanced. We did some EDA and checked for Duplicates in the start. 
Further on, since we had many categories in the Genre Column we encoded it into Numeric form using Label Encoder.
And then we did Feature Extraction. 
Finally, we made the prediction and checked out the Accuracy.

Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction
The Project is on Customer Churn prediction, starting off we did some EDA and dropped the Unwanted Columns. 
Further , we Encoded the Categorical Column using One Hot Encoder which is best for unrelated small categorical data. 
Then i trained several Models to check which one gives the best Accuracy.

Task 4: Spam SMS Detection
As usual we kicked off with doing EDA and dropping the unwanted Columns. Since, it was a binary classification i mapped the classes to either 0 or 1.
Then i did Feature Extraction using Tf-idf Vectorizer. 
Since the data was in three parts we repeated the process for Test and Solution data aswell. 
Finally, we used Logistic Regression Model for Prediction.
